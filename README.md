The Recommendation Machine is a simple command line project that Ryan G and I developed for our Module One final project at the Flatiron school in 2018. The RM accesses Movie, Shows, Music, Books, Authors, and Game recommendations and content via the Tastedive API and associates each recommendation and search query with a user. We built an OO model and active record database to select for recommendations and users.

This app can be forked on GitHub and cloned to a local machine. To be able to pull from the API, simply create an account with Tastedive and insert your API key into the link in the API communicator file. Once you are ready to run, simply execute the ruby bin/run.rb file.

We would value any contributions in areas of user interface, automatically saving queries / adding selected recommendations to lists, and performing more analytical operations on the dataset.

Shoutout to Jon Mines for helping establish our models and schema.
